## What is Stackpack?

Stackpack is a Chrome browser extension that helps developers streamline their StackOverflow research

## Functionality 

Stackpack provides three primary functions to your SO research workflow:

### [1] One-Click Opens###
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/search.png" width="600"></p>

Stackpack will comb your search results and auto-open any StackOverflow link into a new browser tab

After you're done, you can auto-close all research tabs with one more click


### [2] Hover Zoom ###
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/hover.png" width="600"></p>

Mouseover will open an iframe preview of a StackOverflow result, allowing you to make a cursory check of a result's relevance...

...without having to click the link at all!

### [3] Save Links ###
Any great research tool will allow you to click and save URLs for future access
